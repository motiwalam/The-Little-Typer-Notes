Dependent Types Assignment 2

Like the previous assignment, this assignment has two parts: one in
which you use Pie, and one that has you extend your evaluator for
untyped lambda calculus into a normalizer. The Pie exercises cover
chapter 3, and the Haskell exercises cover the concepts of neutral
terms, reading back syntax from values, and normalization from class.

For the Pie assignment, please carefully follow the instructions in
the file 2.pie. In particular, when it requests that you add a
comment, please remember to do so. There will be no partial credit for
these problems, but you can improve your solution after receiving
feedback in order to improve your grade.

For the Haskell assignment, you are provided with an implementation of
untyped normalization by evaluation (NbE). Please add pairs, following
the instructions in Main.hs.

Please write your name and PSU email address at the top of both files.
